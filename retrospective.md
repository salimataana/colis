### Difficulties

the Security part
I try to put the Maps to locate a Packet: unfortenly it doesn't work
For time Problem.

### what I learned

In my Spring Boot project,
I learned how to develop robust web applications
through dependency management and integrating databases
with JPA and MySQL. I also learned how to ensure application security,
which allowed me to master the lifecycle of a Spring Boot application.

### what I will do differently next time

I will test soon.
I will do good planning to take advantage of the time that has been given to me.

### what I will keep at all costs next time

I will do code reviews,because they improve the quality of the code.
